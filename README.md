#Robot Base Project

In this project we control 2 DC motors using an Arduino and L293D IC

In Tinkercad

1-Get a breadboard and an Arduino Uno
2-Connect the Vin pin in the Arduino with the positive pin in the breadboard
3-Connect the GND pin in the Arduino with the ground pin in the breadboard
4-Get L923D IC and connect it in the breadboard
5-Get 2 motors and connect the positive pin of the first motor with output 1 in the IC and the negative pin with output 2 in the IC
6-Connect the positive pin of the second motor with output 3 in the IC and the negative pin with 4
7-Connect the power inputs in the IC with the positive pins in the breadboard
8-Connect the ground pins in the IC with the ground pins in the breadboard
9-Connect Enable 1 & 2 with D6 in the Arduino
10-Connect Input 1 in the IC with D2 in the Arduino
11-Connect Input 2 in the IC with D3 in the Arduino
12-Connect Enable 3 & 4 in the IC with D7 in the Arduino
13-Connect Input 3 in the IC with D4 in the Arduino
13-Connect Input 4 in the IC with D5 in the Arduino
14-Get a battery and connect the positive side with the positive pin in the breadboard
15-Connect the negative side of the battery with the negative pin in the breadboard
16-Write the code and simulate the circuit
